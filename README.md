# FFD: Fast Feature Detector

## Introduction
FFD is a fast scale-invariant feature detector for computer vision tasks. This repo includes the code for keypoint detection from images. Given a pair of images, you can use this repo to extract matching features across the image pair.

* Authors: Morteza Ghahremani, Yonghuai Liu and Bernard Tiddeman



## Dependencies
* Python 3 >= 3.5
* OpenCV >= 3.4 
* NumPy >= 1.18


## Contents
There are two main scripts in this repo:

1. `demo_FFD.py`: runs and shows extracted keypoints located in `image/`
2. `match_pairs.py`: reads an image pair from `image/` and matches (SIFT descriptor is used for feature description)

```sh
python3 demo_FFD.py
python3 match_pairs.py
```
